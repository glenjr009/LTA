# 💰 Dhan Sakshi (धन साक्षी) – Loan Utilization Tracker  

🚀 "Making sure every loan tells its true story"  

Hey there 👋, welcome to Dhan Sakshi (meaning "Money Witness").  
This is our attempt (Team Hexa Titans 🚀) to solve a very real problem in lending:  
👉 loan money often gets misused, and 👉 banks spend way too much time & money on manual checks.  

So, we built a mobile-first, AI-powered solution that makes loan utilization tracking a lot smarter and more transparent.

## 🌟 What’s the idea?  

📱 Offline-First Proof – Borrowers can click photos/videos of purchased assets and save them even if there’s no internet. As soon as they’re back online, everything syncs automatically.  

🤖 AI Fraud Checks – Our backend scans uploads for tampering, weird anomalies, or geo mismatches and flags suspicious cases instantly.  

🔗 Blockchain Audit Trail (future scope) – Every decision (approve/reject) can be logged immutably for compliance & trust.  

In short: fewer field visits, faster approvals, and less fraud.

## 💻 Tech We Used  

Frontend (Mobile Prototype)  
- React (simulating React Native)  
- Tailwind CSS (with our cyber-teal theme ✨)  
- LocalStorage demo for offline-first behavior  

Backend (API + Logic)  
- Node.js + Express  
- Mock DBs: MongoDB (for media metadata) & PostgreSQL (for structured case data)  
- Endpoints for syncing, officer review, and AI simulation

## ⚡ How to Run It  

### Prerequisite: Node.js installed  

### Backend (Port 5000)  
First, open a terminal and move into the backend folder:  
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node index.js

### If everything went fine, you should see:
Node.js Backend Server running on http://localhost:5000

### Frontend (Port 3000)  
In another terminal, move into the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start



Your browser should automatically open at 👉 http://localhost:3000
